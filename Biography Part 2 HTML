      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        
Albert Einstein was a renowned theoretical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest scientific minds in history. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, German Empire. His father, Hermann Einstein, was an engineer, and his mother, Pauline Einstein, was a homemaker.
<br><br>
Early Life and Education:
Einstein showed an early interest in mathematics and science, and at a young age, he was already delving into complex books on these subjects. However, he had difficulty fitting into the traditional school system due to his rebellious nature and dislike for rote learning. His family eventually moved to Munich, where he attended a new school, and he excelled in subjects he was passionate about.

In 1896, at the age of 17, Einstein enrolled at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland, to pursue a degree in physics and mathematics. He graduated in 1900 and became a Swiss citizen in 1901.
<br><br>
The Annus Mirabilis:
In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that would revolutionize the field of physics. This year became known as his "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year). These papers addressed different topics:

The photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for quantum theory, for which he would later receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
Brownian motion, confirming the existence of atoms and molecules, which had been a topic of debate among scientists.
Special Theory of Relativity, introducing the famous equation E=mc², which relates energy (E) and mass (m) in the context of high-speed motion.
The equivalence of mass and energy, an extension of his Special Theory of Relativity.
General Theory of Relativity and Fame:
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, provided a new understanding of gravity, explaining it as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory revolutionized the understanding of the universe and made Einstein an international celebrity. <br><br>

During the 1920s and 1930s, Einstein traveled extensively, giving lectures and advocating for pacifism, civil rights, and Zionism. He left Germany in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi regime, and he settled in the United States, where he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        Einstein's work on the theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E=mc², showed the equivalence of energy and mass, laying the foundation for nuclear energy and atomic bombs. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle-like properties of light.
        <br><br>
        In addition to his scientific achievements, Einstein was a prominent advocate for civil rights, pacifism, and education. He became an international symbol of intellectual curiosity and creativity.
<br><br>
        Einstein continued his scientific work and made important contributions to the field, but he also focused on more philosophical and humanitarian endeavors. He remained a vocal advocate for civil rights and spoke out against racism and discrimination.
<br><br>
Albert Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76, in Princeton, New Jersey. His legacy endures through his scientific contributions, which transformed our understanding of the universe, as well as his humanitarian efforts, which inspire people to this day.
<br><br>
Einstein's name has become synonymous with genius, and his work continues to influence physicists and researchers worldwide. He is considered one of the most iconic and influential scientists in history, and his ideas have shaped the foundation of modern physics.
